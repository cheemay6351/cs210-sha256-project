The King is lying on his lily pad, coughing.
The King inhales and launches into a violent coughing fit.

Alright, let's not overdo it.
All the Princesses have gathered for Fiona's baby shower.
The Princesses all gaze at her.
Just precious! Look at her!
The birds and forest creatures all flock to Snow White.
They chirp and hoot happily.
Oh, Fiona, won't you please open mine first?
It's the one in front.
You know the baby's gonna love it because I do!
The other girls scowl at her.
You're too kind, Snow, but I can't accept this.
Think nothing of it. I've got six more at home.
There is a loud explosion and the door blows open.
The boat cuts through the open sea.
Just make sure they don't die of famine.
Shrek interrupts with a mock laugh.
The boat suddenly pitches to the right.
Puss, tired of being wet, shakes himself vigorously.
He is not exactly king material.

Well, I doubt he was worse than mine.
My dad wasn't really the fatherly type either.
Artie laughs and then pokes at the fire.
I'm sorry but this just isn't working for me.

Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Hang on a second.
Can you believe this is happening?
Use the stairs, your father paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son..
Ma! I got a thing going here.
You got lint on your fuzz.
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Is that fuzz gel?
A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school, three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. 
I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
You did come back different.
Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Hear about Frankie?
You going to the funeral?
No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.

She's my cousin!
What do you think he makes?
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
What does that do?
Saves us millions.
Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
Now we only have to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Why would you question anything?
We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things work too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Wait a second. Check it out.
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
I wonder where they were.
I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
Let's have fun with them.
Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
Six miles, huh?
Maybe I am.
You are not!
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
Dad, you surprised me.
You decide what you're interested in?
Well, there's a lot of choices.
But you only get one.
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
I'm not trying to be funny.
You're gonna be a stirrer?
No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
I'm so proud.
We're starting work today!
Today's the day.
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Yeah, right.
Is it still available?
Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Congratulations!
Step to the side.
What'd you get?
Picking crud out. Stellar!
Couple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Make your choice.
You want to go first?
I don't think I'll be able to move again.
Oh, my. What's available?
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
Any chance of getting the Krelman?
Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
Oh, this is so hard!
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine.
What happened to you?
Where are you?
I'm going out.
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
You got a rain advisory today.
Bees cannot fly in rain.
So be careful.
Murphy's at home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
That's awful.
All right, launch positions!
I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.
Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
They do get behind a fellow.
Let's see what this baby'll do.
Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.
We're all aware of what they do in the woods.
How do you like the smell of flames?!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?
What horrible thing has happened here?
He's not bothering anybody.
I told you not to yell at him.
He runs up the steps into the church.
You are way out of position, rookie!
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
The other side of the bed is cold.
He is already fighting hard to stay alive.
All right, I'll make a deal with you.
Most quick tempered of the Hyenas.
Friend and companion of Simba.
She can pin Simba in a wrestling match.
I wouldn't dream of challenging you.

Andy's hand pulls out one of Mr. Potato Head's eyes.
Are you gonna come quietly?
You saved the day again, Woody.
The rocket hurtles upward higher and higher.
You're going to jail, Bart.
Say good-bye to the wife and tater tots.
There's an elegant glass of orange juice.
You're my favorite deputy.
Oh, you're getting heavy.
Etch, you've been working on that draw.
I was close to being scared that time.
We've only got one week left before the move.
I don't want any toys left behind.
This is bigger than anything we've ever seen.
Right where you paid me to bring you.
Do you want to build a snowman?
What have you done? This is getting out of hand!
She's ice cold.
Listen to me, Elsa, your power will only grow.
I'm scared. It's getting stronger!
Getting upset only makes it worse. Calm down.
Excuse me for a minute.
She must be stopped! You have to go after her.
She's my sister, she would never hurt me.
Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers?
Who marries a man she just met?
Do you think you could show us the way?
No, I'm just trying to protect you!
Come on, you can do it!
A single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens.
It had the ability to heal the sick, and injured.
You might want to remember her.
The magic of the golden flower, healed the queen.
A healthy baby girl, a princess was born.
The King and Queen launched a flying lantern into the sky.
For that one moment, everything was perfect.
Rapunzel is asleep in her crib.
It turns brown and falls upon the mattress, powerless.
Gothel raised the child as her own.
Gothel broke into the castle and stole the child.
The outside world is a dangerous place.
Filled with horrible, selfish people.
Just like they do on my birthday, each year.
We do this job, you can buy your own castle.
Rapunzel, I'm not getting any younger down here.
I see a strong, confident, beautiful young lady.
Look at you, as fragile as a flower.
That's right, to keep you safe, and sound, dear.
Don't ever ask to leave this tower, again.
Well it's easy for you to say.
You guys look amazing.
I just thought it was a better idea than, stars.
Who are you, and how did you find me?
Well, you could imagine what happened next.
The lost Princess had returned.
I should have been hiding from you.
That criminal is to be hanged for his crimes.
Frankly I'm too scared to ask about the frog.
She would be heart broken, you're right.
No, I am seeing those lanterns.
Stay calm, it can probably smell fear.
I have magic hair that glows when I sing.
Look, I told you he was here.
Look at him! Quiet. Look at him.
Here, I fetched a pail of water.
Look at our little mutant babies!
I should've stayed.
Shrek had this thing he had to do.
What? Say it one more time.
What you talking about?
Are you serious?
You don't have to worry about a thing.
I'll always be here to make sure nobody bothers you.
You're bothering me.
If you want to be a part of this family.
